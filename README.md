### 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 Passionate about **IoT systems** and their integration with cloud services and mobile platforms.
- 🔧 I have completed several practical projects, including:
  - 📡 **Smart Air Quality Monitoring Station** – An IoT system using ESP32 to monitor PM2.5, temperature, and humidity, with real-time data sent to Blynk.
  - 🔐 **Smart Door Lock System** – Designed with custom PCB, enabling remote control via Blynk, Firebase sync, and offline access log storage via EEPROM.
- 🤖 Also experienced in **semantic segmentation** using **PyTorch**, particularly for spectrogram-based signal analysis.
- 📱 Basic understanding of **Flutter** for building mobile apps that interface with embedded systems.
